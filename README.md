# ⛈️ Thunder Distance Calculator

### Why I Built This
Working from my office, I often catch fireworks displays out of the corner of my eye. It always follows the same pattern:

- I glimpse a flash of light in the distance
- I think "I should count the seconds until I hear the sound to figure out where they're coming from"
- The boom reaches my office a few moments later
- I go back to work and promptly forget about the whole thing

This cycle repeated until I finally decided to build a solution. Now, whenever I see fireworks (or lightning!), I can quickly jump to this web app, mark my position, and precisely calculate the distance to the source.

### How It Works

When you see a flash (fireworks or lightning), mark your position on the map
A circle expands outward at the speed of sound (343 m/s)
When you hear the boom, stop the expansion
The app calculates the distance to the source

### Features

- 🗺️ Interactive map with location search and geolocation
- 🔄 Multiple measurements with color-coding for tracking different events
- 💾 Remembers your position between visits
- 📱 Works on both mobile and desktop

The best use case that I found for these models is to quickly get these little prototypes and apps out of my mind and onto real code.
They are a motor of getting these little things done, I like that.
